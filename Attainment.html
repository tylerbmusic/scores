  <h1>Song title: Attainment</h1><br>
  <h2>Composed for a String Quartet</h2><br>
  <p>Idea behind the title: The two violins are siblings growing up together, and when they become adults they separate but still meet up every once in a while. The Viola and Cello are the violins' parents, and become old, get dementia, and die when the violins are adults, and the violins mourn then continue with their lives. Then, the violins retire (independantly) and get weaker until they too get dementia. Of course, since they have dementia, they don't have recent memories and are reliving the memorable parts of their childhood. One violin dies of heart disease, and the other dies of cancer. Their deaths seem expected but also sudden ("it happened too soon").</p>
