  <h1 class="txt">Song title: Attainment</h1><br>
  <h2 class="txt">Composed for a String Quartet</h2><br>
  <p class="txt">Idea behind the title: The song follows two violins who are siblings growing up together, not always getting along but sometimes getting along. When they become adults they separate but still meet up every once in a while. The viola and cello are the violins' parents, and become old, get dementia, and die when the violins are adults, and the violins mourn then continue with their lives. Then, the violins retire (independently) and get weaker until they too get dementia. Of course, since they have dementia, they don't have recent memories and are reliving the memorable parts of their childhood. One violin dies of heart disease (specifically coronary artery disease), and the other dies of breast cancer. Their deaths seem expected but also sudden ("it happened too soon").</p><br>

  <p class="txt">The violins now have jobs. Violin I is a cashier at a grocery store, and violin II is a software engineer. The parents will retire within the next two to four measures.</p><br>
